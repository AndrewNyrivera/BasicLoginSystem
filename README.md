# BasicLoginSystem
##This is a basic login system made to store values such as username and password to see if you can login. You can also create your own account, making your own username and password.

##This project was made for fun just to further my knowledge with saving to .txt files and getting foot through the door when it comes to databases. This was a fun and easy project to do. Really helped me to understand how to read and write to files and use if else statements to varify usernames.

#If you want to test it out yourself, first make sure your have the latest python installed, then you can download the zip file and run it in your terminal for mac os or command prompt for windows. You can also use pretty much any text editor or IDE to run it. Lots of fun :D and really opens your mind what what your code can do.


##Remeber this is a very basic login system so there are probably many bugs that need to be fixed.
